tintin-scripts
==============

This is my collection of tintin++ scripts for WoTMUD.

If you desire to use any of them, put them in your tintin++ script file. 
Pasting them into tintin++ manually won't have the desired effect.

If you're having issues with `#highlight` then set packet patch to something: 
`#config {packet patch} {.17}` Mess around with it until you find the number you like.

`#line` has some issues with tintin-2.00.9, either use 2.00.8 or 2.01.0 beta 
for now if you need `#line` to function properly.
