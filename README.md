tintin-scripts
==============

This is my collection of tintin++ scripts for WoTMUD.

I may or may not be using these myself at any given time.

If you desire to use any of them, put them in your tintin++ script file. Pasting
them into tintin++ manually won't have the desired effect.

If you're having issues with #highlight then set packet patch to something:
`#config {packet patch} {.1}`
Mess around with it until you find something you like.
