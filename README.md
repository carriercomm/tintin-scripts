tintin-scripts
==============

This is my collection of [tintin++](http://tintin.sourceforge.net) ([http://tintin.sourceforge.net]()) scripts for WoTMUD.

I have changed the format of my scripts, now you can copy/paste directly into tintin++.

If you're having issues with colors or `#highlight` then set packet patch to something: 
`#config {packet patch} {.17}` Mess around with it until you find the number you like.

`#line` has some issues with tintin-2.00.9, you should update.

These may work to some extent in wintin++. I have no idea. If you try some of my scripts
and find that they do work, consider letting me know and I'll make a note about it in
the appropriate README.

If you would like tintin++ to be wrapped up in gtk and vte, see
[vtin](https://github.com/rascul/vtin).
