comms-logger
============

This is useful for logging all tells, yells, narrates, chats and speaks to a file. 
What makes it really useful is that you can set your terminal running tintin++ to 
be always on bottom, then make a smaller window, run 'tail -f .wotmod-comms' in 
the smaller window, and have a comms window.
