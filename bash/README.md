bash
====

This is a simple bash script. Turn it on with `bon` and off with `boff`.
While it is on, if you attempt to bash someone who is already stunned,
it will simply keep trying to bash again until it goes through. This 
script is not complex and can be easily defeated. This is no substitute
for skill and proper bash timing.
