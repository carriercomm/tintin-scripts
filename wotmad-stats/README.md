wotmad-stats
============

NOTE: THIS SCRIPT IS FOR WOTMAD http://wotmad.herokuapp.com

This script allows you to automatically submit your new stats to this site. 
Note that you'll need to set your API key, which you can get by going to 
the stats page and clicking the 'contribute' link. Once you have your API 
key, set it by typing this in the command input: wotmad_stat_apikey <key here> 
Where <key here> is your API key, without the angled brackets. Wget must be 
installed and in $PATH. Unknown at this time if this will work with WinTin++.
