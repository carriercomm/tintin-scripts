horse
=====

This script makes leading and riding easy when there's multiple horses around.
To set your horse, use the `horse` alias. Or use `hh` to set $horse to horse.
To ride or lead the horse, use `rh` or `lh`. To ride or lead a specific horse,
use something like `rh 3` to ride 3.$horse or `lh 2` to lead 2.$horse. `dh` will
dismount. `dih` will diagnose a horse, and you can use `dih` for specific horses
the same as you can with `rh` or `lh`.
